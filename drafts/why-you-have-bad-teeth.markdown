The dentist always says the same thing: floss every day, brush twice per day, don't eat too much sugar. But it seems no matter how well you follow this advice, you're always having dental issues anyway. You believe you're genetically cursed, but the reality is there are other extremely important factors you have yet to learn about. My hope is that by reading this, you'll save yourself the physical pain of those scary metal tools and the financial pain of burning thousands of dollars on procedures. You'll also be equipped to ask your dentist more probing questions and really get your money's worth on consulting their expertise.

First, let's recap the commonly known dietary factors impacting oral health: sugary, starchy, and acidic foods. Sugars don't directly damage teeth; instead, they feed bacteria that promote an acidic environment in the mouth, and those acids erode tooth enamel. Starches are broken down into simple sugars by the amylase enzyme in saliva, creating the same effect. And of course, acidic foods/beverages like citrus fruits and coffee or soda can similarly damage teeth, even when they are sugar-free. [This 2004 paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14685022/) with 624 citations at this time of writing describes much of this common knowledge, but it also highlights something most people don't consider:

> _A very important biological parameter is saliva. Several salivary protective mechanisms come into play during an erosive challenge: dilution and clearance of an erosive agent from the mouth, neutralisation and buffering of acids, and slowing down the rate of enamel dissolution through the common ion effect by salivary calcium and phosphate_ [Zero and Lussi, 2000].\_

Saliva is a protective agent against foods that typically erode teeth, working preventatively to protect against acids and remedially to remineralize enamel once damaged. So the goal as humans who enjoy eating is not to stress over foods that can damage teeth, but to maintain a proper salivary profile that allows us to consume these foods in reasonable amounts without any lasting consequences. What will follow in this discussion here is demonstrating that people who are stumped about their recurring dental problems don't magically have bad teeth for no reason, but simply have room to improve their salivary protection and fix their problems for good.

#### Buffing Your Saliva

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6579891/](This study) put children on an experimental diet as follows:

A poor-nutrition diet of institutionalized children was replaced with an imperfect but more nutritious diet that included less sugar while being less sticky and required more chewing.

#### Phytates Impair Mineral Absorption

Today's popular dietary dogma includes grains, nuts, seeds, and legumes as primary sources of energy. Unfortunately, these foods contain [antinutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinutrient), namely phytic acid, that reduce the absorption of dietary minerals like zinc, copper, calcium, and magnesium; all of which are critical to good dental health.

#### Zinc

[This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24815985/) demonstrates zinc's importance on the integrity of tooth enamel. [Several plant foods, like oats](https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/zinc-what-it-does-for-the-body-and-the-best-food-sources), include an abundance of zinc, so most plant-focused eaters should not have a problem eating enough on paper. And yet, a number of studies like [this one](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40580803/) plainly state:

> _We observed a high prevalence of imminent or manifest zinc deficiency among vegetarians and vegans._

It is therefore reasonable to conclude that anyone who relies on phytate-rich foods as staples (not just vegetarians) should be more wary of zinc intake.

Now that we've covered the obvious stuff, let's look at some surprising research findings. [Here is a simple observational study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23714722/) comparing the dental health of vegetarians and non-vegetarians. On one hand, the vegetarians had better gum health than the non-vegetarians, but the typical flaw in vegetarian versus non-vegetarian studies is you're not actually comparing vegetarians with meat-eaters; you're comparing people who are selective with their diet and lifestyle with people who are not. The vegetarians in this study were also more educated, meaning socioeconomic factors likely played a role as well. Yet despite these advantages, and better gum health, the vegetarian group still had significantly more tooth decay and erosion. How is that possible? The goal is not to pick on vegetarians specifically, but to ask what it is about certain lifestyle patterns that promote more tooth decay than others.
