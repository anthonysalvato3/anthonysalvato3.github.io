The funny thing about science is we can't actually prove anything. The best we can do is gather evidence, and hopefully that evidence is strong enough to support an argument beyond a reasonable doubt. Nutrition science in particular is tricky because of how much does _not_ have that kind of strong evidence. Even more troublesome is that weak evidence is often presented as strong to support an agenda or sell a product. Recently, a growing number of nutrition enthusiasts have started fervently opposing the consumption of seed oils (typically marketed as "vegetable oils"). Some experts dismiss this concern, stating that evidence overwhelmingly supports the use of seed oils as both safe and healthy. In the past, most of us would have no choice but to accept these opinions at face value. But, thanks to the beauty of the information age, we can access cutting-edge science with a few clicks from the comfort of our bedrooms. It's still not always easy to figure things out, but I did the research and wrote this post to make everything extremely simple. That way, you're guaranteed to walk away with a much better understanding of what's going on with seed oils.

#### Why Are Seed Oils Promoted as Healthy?

Seed oils, rich in omega-6 **polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs)**, decrease **LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)** in the blood when compared with sources of **saturated fats (SFAs)**, like meat and dairy. This phenomenon has been demonstrated repeatedly to the point where even the most staunch seed oil opponents accept it as fact. But those results are often extrapolated with creative language claiming that PUFAs improve heart health. It's true that in a statistical vacuum, higher LDL-C correlates with higher incidence of heart disease. But this vacuum ignores that LDL-C can be high for multiple reasons: some indicate metabolic problems, and others are benign. That's why in order to assess overall cardiovascular risk, we don't look at LDL-C alone. Instead, we look at multiple markers to try and figure out what's going on in body, and whether LDL-C is elevated for healthy or unhealthy reasons. So, focusing on a single parameter to dictate whether or not one should consume seed oils is extremely myopic. I'll do a deep dive on cholesterol and heart disease in the future, which is why if you're not already subscribed to these blog updates, you will benefit greatly by doing so right now at the bottom of this page.

#### The Theoretical Problem With Seed Oils

When asked about seed oils, internet personalities usually start talking too much and making things unnecessarily complicated. Complicated talking points means we depend on an allegiance to these self-proclaimed experts. Our dependency is great for their business, but bad for actual understanding. Succinctly answering the question "why are seed oils theoretically harmful" can be simplified into one word: **oxidation**. That means that due to their carbon-to-carbon double bonds (chemistry stuff), the PUFAs in these oils can be oxidized (loss of an electron) through various means, like exposure to light, heat, oxygen, or free radicals in the body. The oxidized fats can then steal electrons back from cells in the body, stabilizing the fats but damaging the cells. If you want a more formal scientific understanding of what happens, read about [lipid peroxidation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_peroxidation).

Even with a well-established process elucidated, implications aren't clear from theory alone. On one side of the spectrum, some argue that PUFAs from _all_ sources should be minimized as much as possible because PUFAs are the types of fats most easily oxidized. To those people, consuming mostly SFAs makes mechanistic sense. On the opposite extreme, others argue that research demonstrates clear benefits of PUFAs over SFAs in humans, and SFAs should therefore be substituted with PUFAs as much as possible. They claim that harmfulness of junk foods, which almost always contain seed oils, is due to other factors. The overall controversy is a result of people having opinions all over that spectrum, with the most extreme people on both sides getting the most attention due to the nature of social media. Now that we understand the spectrum of what is being argued, we can start looking at research.

#### Human Trials and Their Limitations

A good science experiment isolates a single variable and determines outcomes based on that variable. If we could recruit a large sample of genetically identical humans and keep them in the same environment for a long period of time, that would be great for research. But, for obvious ethical reasons, we can't create an army of genetic clones and lock them in a lab for decades. Instead, scientists recruit as many people as financially feasible and practical as possible, with vaguely similar health backgrounds based on a few measurements. A lot of variability is still left on the table. The result is that even if a human study has a clear significant outcome, nuances are usually unaccounted for, and a similar study might even result in a different outcome. Thus, cherry-picking individual studies to support one's own bias becomes very easy.

Going back to seed oils, the way many human trials involving seed oils are designed are not by substituting one entire dietary pattern with another, but by taking an existing dietary pattern and substituting external sources of fats. What that usually means is finding a bunch of participants and instructing them to substitute SFAs with PUFAs (usually seed oils). In other words, if participants were to spread butter on their bread or sour cream on their baked potato, they would instead be instructed to use a PUFA-rich spread or oil, like in [this study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-001-0768-3). Or perhaps the researchers might provide them with some baked goods that contain a SFA-rich oil versus a PUFA-rich one, demonstrated [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24550191/). These types of studies often favor seed oils. Why? That's a complicated deep dive for another time, but the main idea is that [eating SFAs with a subpar diet is _not_ the same as eating them within a diet of natural whole foods](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32562735/). Additionally, these studies usually use a small sample size, and the PUFA group almost certainly knows they are in the "healthy" intervention group, which may influence their behaviors. Also possible is that similar studies were done, showed contradictory results, and were never published, due to the bias of the publisher. Large government-funded organizations like the American Diabetes Association are unlikely to publish findings that challenge the superiority of PUFAs because they have been staunchly anti-SFA for decades. Finally, participants in these studies usually do not consume oils in their most oxidized forms, which are in packaged and fried foods. All of these caveats are why the aforementioned substitution studies can deceptively provoke the conclusion that SFAs cause diabetes, fatty liver, and all kinds of bad stuff, while oils that did not exist for 99.97% of human history protect us from these terrible diseases.

#### What Animal Studies Reveal

Curious minds often dismiss animal studies because they see a new cure for cancer in mice every week and inherently know that those dramatic results will not likely be replicated in humans. But while every species has its unique biology, humans and other animals are wired similarly in enough ways to gather very interesting findings, albeit with grains of salt. The colossal advantage of animal studies over human ones is that animals can be both genetically programmed and environmentally nurtured identically. That means almost every variable can be controlled for and the result of the experiment is much more reliable, even if not always directly applicable to humans. [This study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32284066/) demonstrates the perils of oil oxidation in a way that human studies cannot. Rabbits were fed either no oil, single time heated oil (STHO), or repeated time heated oil (RTHO). Returning to the theoretical problem with seed oils, we'd expect the oil exposed to more heat to cause more damage in the rabbits due to more oxidation. That's exactly what happened:

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/images/oils/rabbit-weight.jpg" 
        alt="Rabbit Body Weight With Different Oil Heating">
    <figcaption><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7155260/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7155260/</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Total body weight, liver fat, and oxidative stress were significantly higher in rabbits fed RTHO, despite consuming less food! It's not a fluke; a [similar study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28959587/) was done on rats with similar results. So although rabbits and rats aren't the same as humans, we can see that oxidative stress can potentially cause metabolic disease. To strengthen that hypothesis, we already observe that in humans, those who consume large amounts of oxidized oil (via ultra-processed food) tend to gain more weight and have more health problems than those who don't. On the other hand, the results of STHO-fed animals were similar to that of the control groups, which suggests that normal use of seed oils for home cooking with limited heat exposure might not be as harmful as the anti-seed-oil crowd claims. That's probably because endogenous antioxidant defense systems can handle _some_ amount of oxidation, which explains why un-oxidized PUFAs from natural foods (despite being susceptible to oxidation in the body) and moderately-oxidized PUFAs from STHO do not cause the same problems as the extremely-oxidized PUFAs in RTHO. In short, eating oil from ultra-processed/fast food leads to much higher oxidative stress than cooking from home with the same oil, because oil in factory manufacturing or in a deep fryer is exposed to much more heat/light/pressure. That being said, I'm personally sticking with cooking fats like butter and tallow for their high stability.

#### Are Seed Oils Contributing to Colon Cancer?

Incidence of colon cancer has [exploded](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-people-in-the-us-get-colon-cancer/) amongst younger adults in recent years. Interestingly, [a BMJ study analyzing CRC tumors](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39658263/) published late last year [made rounds in news headlines](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-high-in-seed-oils-could-be-fueling-colon-cancer-risk/), driving speculation that the tumors could be driven by seed oil consumption in ultra-processed foods. In the study, tumors were found to contain significantly higher levels of the PUFA **arachidonic acid (AA)**, its derivatives, and its precursor **linoleic acid (LA)** than control samples. Because LA is found abundantly in seed oils, the study authors raised the possibility of Western diets high in omega-6 PUFAs contributing to the dysregulated lipid metabolism found in the tumor cells. They are not suggesting that LA and AA are enough to cause cancer on their own, but that high concentrations can sometimes reveal defects in mediators that are supposed to resolve inflammation during the metabolism of these lipids.

So if food sources of LA might increase colon cancer risk, does that mean foods like walnuts or hemp seeds which are high in LA might also be risky? Once again, evidence strongly suggests that it's the _oxidation_ that matters rather than the simple presence of LA on its own. Normally, the conversion of LA to AA is low, [but the conversion increases dramatically when seed oils (which contain lots of LA) are heated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26094213/). Going back to the [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39658263/](BMJ) study, we see a coordinated inflammatory signaling cascade:

> _Of note, genes linked to arachidonic acid lipid production (PLA2G4A and TNF), genes related to pro-inflammatory mediators (ALOX5, ALOX5AP, LTA4H, LTC4S) and their receptors (LTB4R, CYSLTR1, CYSLTR2) all appear to be coordinately expressed along with the inflammatory biomarkers (TGFB1, NFKB1, NFKB2) and associated macrophage markers (CCL2, CCR2) in colon tumours._

We see increased AA production in both the cancer tumors _and_ in a live experiment with consumption of heated oil, strongly supporting the idea that the inflammatory cascade caused by oxidation is the problem. A lot of seed oil opponents on the internet are claiming that AA itself is inflammatory and to skip the oils for natural fats in meat. I support the idea of sticking with super nutritious foods like meat, but actually, demonizing AA from seed oil doesn't make sense because AA is abundant in meat! At the same time, seed oil proponents correctly state that LA and AA from oils do not cause inflammation, but they totally ignore that consuming them oxidized does. So both seed oil proponents and opponents are missing important pieces of what's happening, and are thus stuck in a nonsensical gridlock argument.

#### Silly Quotes From Experts

> _It's true that we eat more ultra-processed junk food than we ever have before, but the evidence is clear that the harms of this kind of food have more to do with their calories and their high amounts of added sugar, sodium and saturated fat than with seed oil._

— [Christopher Gardner](https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2025/03/5-things-to-know-about-the-effects-of-seed-oils-on-health.html)

The sugar criticism is fair, and sodium is contextual, but junk foods are almost always _low_ in saturated fat because their fat comes from seed oils. So it doesn't make sense that I continuously see quotes from doctors and dietitians about junk food being high in SFA. Even given the extremely strict recommended limit on SFA intake, a diet composed entirely of potato chips would _still_ be under that limit. It's right on the nutrition label; how do these people have prestigious titles at world-class universities but forget how to read?

> _But while some scientists argue that you shouldn't have too much omega 6 compared to omega 3, \[Matti\] Marklund says it's better to up your intake of omega 3 rather than consume less omega 6, as both are associated with health benefits._

— [The BBC](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250530-are-seed-oils-really-bad-for-you)

The average American consumes [749 calories of seed oil per day](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS). That is an absurd amount of omega-6 PUFA. Omega-3 consumption should increase, but that's tough to fit without omega-6 consumption going down. Even ignoring all oxidation arguments, shouldn't Matti be encouraging people not to eat so much oil because it has almost zero nutritional value?

> _We know that ultraprocessed foods generally are not good for your health. They are usually high in sodium or salt, added sugars, unhealthy fats, and additives. That's why it's bad for you, not the inclusion of seed oils._

— [Matti Marklund](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-behind-seed-oils-health-effects)

I am curious to know which "unhealthy fats" Matti is talking about, because once again, the fats in ultra-processed foods are almost always exclusively seed oils.

> _Some of the influencers are talking about getting rid of all the omega-6 in the diet, and that would be a terrible idea. Some omega-6 is absolutely required. The question is how much?_

— [Tom Brenna](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/nx-s1-5453769/nutrition-canola-rfk-seed-oils-soybean)

Consuming any source of fat will provide more than enough omega-6 PUFA, because every source of fat contains a mix of different types of fats. Even with a high-SFA carnivore diet, for example, enough omega-6 PUFA is present in the food. Short of consuming no fat at all, which would be deadly, consuming too little omega-6 PUFA is virtually impossible.

#### Conclusion

[Striking correlations](https://www.jeffnobbs.com/posts/what-causes-chronic-disease) between seed oil consumption and disease over the past century aren't enough on their own to implicate seed oils as a major culprit of declining health. However, controlled trials with oxidized oil support the correlations and present serious concerns. While evidence is not strong enough to conclude that home cooking at reasonable quantities and temperatures within a nutritious diet causes noticeable problems, seed oil defenders ignore the most common means of consumption, which is through packaged and fried foods. At the same time, seed oils are inappropriately labeled as heart-healthy simply because they lower blood cholesterol levels. Too many experts dismiss the concern of oxidized oil in junk food and point fingers at other ingredients instead. They also never mention the huge amount of oil that the average person is already consuming. No matter what kind of diet one follows, consuming fats from real foods should be a priority. With that strategy, the need for added fats is minimized.
