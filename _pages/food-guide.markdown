Below is a basic eating philosophy based around minimizing oxidative stress and maximizing overall health. I'm updating this periodically as I discover new ideas.

#### Nutrients to Reduce Oxidative Stress

These should be prioritized, in no particular order:

- High-quality protein (needed for synthesizing glutathione, which is essential for all antioxidant activity)

- Manganese (required for superoxide dismutase, which reduces superoxide radicals)

- Zinc (required for superoxide dismutase)

- Copper (required for superoxide dismutase)

- Iron (required for the catalase enzyme, which reduces hydrogen peroxide. Heme iron from animal sources is the most bioavailable form)

- Selenium (required for glutathione peroxidase, which reduces hydrogen peroxide)

- Vitamin E (needed to combat lipid peroxidation. Not much is needed if little polyunsaturated fat is consumed)

- Vitamin C (required for recycling vitamin E)

- Antioxidant-supporting phytochemicals (can directly reduce superoxide or upregulate overall antioxidant activity via hormesis)

- B vitamins niacin and riboflavin (required for glutathione recycling)

Note that while protein can be safely eaten in abundance by most people, some vitamins and minerals require more careful balance. That means supplementing with them in high doses can result in negative side effects, so getting them from whole food sources is best.

#### Best Protein Sources

Animal foods are superior for obtaining high-quality protein and fat. Not only are they delicious, but they also contain a wide range of vitamins and minerals that support the antioxidant defense system. Meat, eggs, and dairy are all high in saturated and monounsaturated fats, which are highly resistant to lipid peroxidation. Fish are high in omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, which, unlike omega-6 polyunsaturated fats, [have been shown to reduce lipid peroxidation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11938024/) and offer a plethora of other benefits, according to research.

Plant proteins are less bioavailable, do not contain all essential amino acids, and the foods containing them generally do not taste as good as animal foods. While there is nothing inherently wrong with plant protein, obtaining an abundance of high-quality protein from plant sources is more challenging. The amino acids glutamate, cysteine, and glycine are particularly important for glutathione synthesis, so those consuming protein primarily from plant sources will need to carefully manage their diet to ensure they are getting sufficient amounts.

#### Best Fat Sources

As mentioned, many animal foods already naturally contain fat. Some fruits, such as olives, avocados, and coconuts, are also nutrient-rich sources of fat. For cooking, tallow, butter, ghee, coconut oil, and palm oil are the most oxidation-resistant to heating. Extra virgin olive oil of verifiable quality can be beneficial, as its polyphenols have been studied extensively for their antioxidant benefits, but heating it makes it more oxidation-prone. Probably not a big deal during basic home cooking, but worth noting.

Oils derived from seeds should be approached with caution. That means canola, soybean, sunflower, safflower, grapeseed, etc. Unlike fruit oils (olive, avocado, coconut, palm) that can be extracted from simple pressing, these oils require an [extensive refining process](https://www.madehow.com/Volume-1/Cooking-Oil.html) to extract and are highly susceptible to oxidation, especially when heated. I [wrote a post](https://stopbigfood.com/the-seed-oil-debate-demystified/) talking about the seed oil debate in more detail, but in short, avoiding seed oils in ultraprocessed and deep-fried foods is much more important than worrying about using a bit to grease the pan at home. That being said, there's no reason for me personally to use them, so I don't.

Nuts contain useful minerals but have limited protein. They also contain phytic acid and lectins, antinutrients that can inhibit the absorption of their minerals, so the listed mineral content will be greater than what is actually absorbed. This is because nuts are seeds, and from a naturalistic perspective, seeds containing antinutrients to protect against predation makes sense. I don't mind eating nuts occasionally, but I don't have them as a staple. Eating them more liberally in the past caused some problems for me, and I also don't think they have enough protein or other valuable nutrients to be more than a secondary food source.

Dairy can have useful nutrients like protein and calcium. Some forms are more nutritious than others. I regularly eat hard cheeses but in modest portions because it's not great for my skin, and because there are more nutritious foods around. Milk and yogurt can be highly nutritious, but I personally rarely consume them simply because they aren't my personal preference. When I do consume milk, I much prefer it from a local farm because it tastes way better and supports small farmers over big agribusiness.

Conventionally, nutrition professionals worry about saturated fat, which is found in several of the foods listed above. I personally have zero concern about saturated fat in the context of my own nutritious diet, and I'll explain why in a future post.

#### Best Carbohydrate Sources

Carbohydrates are non-essential in the human diet; however, many people, including myself, prefer to include them to optimize their health. Their consumption should be secondary to nutrient-rich animal foods, though the amount of carbohydrates consumed depends on individual preferences and needs. Some people thrive on zero carbohydrates, and that's perfectly fine.

Fruit is delicious, nutrient-rich, and contains polyphenols, some of which can directly scavenge superoxide radicals (like flavonoids), while others can activate the transcription factor NRF2. This activation signals genes to upregulate the production of enzymes that facilitate antioxidant activity, such as glutamate-cysteine ligase. Raw honey contains only trace nutrients but is abundant in polyphenols that can scavenge superoxide and other free radicals. The types and quantity of polyphenols vary because honey depends on the types of flowers from which the bees have collected nectar. Darker honeys are typically higher in polyphenols.

Refined grains should be avoided in favor of whole grains, but all grains, because they are seeds, contain phytic acid and lectins. That means grain-eaters need to be more wary of mineral intake. Furthermore, in some people, gluten can increase gut permeability by reacting with a protein in the gut called zonulin, loosening the tight junctions and allowing bacterial remnants called lipopolysaccharides into the bloodstream. This leakage can trigger an immune response, which can contribute to oxidative stress because immune cells generate ROS to kill pathogens, and ROS from immune cells can potentially leak into surrounding tissue. Therefore, if wheat is chosen as food, knowing about one's own gluten sensitivity is prudent. Moreover, homemade fermented sourdough has reduced gluten and antinutrient content, making it a healthier choice. Note that most store-bought breads in US stores are low-quality junk food, even many of the 100% whole grain breads (check the ingredients). Try your local bakery for better options. The best store-bought bread by a wide margin is [Ezekiel Bread](https://www.amazon.com/Food-Life-Organic-Sprouted-Grain/dp/B000REY4MO), which can sometimes be found in freezer aisles due to its lack of preservatives.

Beans and lentils are affordable and nutrient-rich sources of carbohydrates, but, like grains, they are seeds and contain lectins and phytic acid (once again, be wary of minerals). Soaking and cooking them can reduce the antinutrient content, while fermenting can reduce it even further. Overall, they can be a solid source of nutrients at a low financial cost. One problem is the fiber and indigestible sugars can cause heavy bloating and gas. I don't eat them as staples because they give me horrible stomachaches and gas in high quantities, and animal sources of protein offer a far superior nutritional profile. But I won't say no if they are present in the occasional tacos or chili; I'm usually ok in that case.

My overall ranking of carbohydrate sources is:

1. Fruit: Delicious and nutrient-rich. Often contains bioactive polyphenolic antioxidants.

2. Raw Honey: Extremely delicious and contains a high concentration of bioactive polyphenolic antioxidants, but lacks a significant amount of nutrients.

3. Root Vegetables: Potatoes, especially, are very nutritious but taste bland. Some potatoes and other root vegetables are high in oxalates, so people with oxalate issues may want to limit them.

4. Beans: A good source of nutrients when prepared properly; contains protein and is affordable, but can taste bland and cause digestive discomfort.

5. Fermented Whole-Grain Sourdough Bread: Tastes good and has some beneficial nutrients.

6. Non-Gluten-Containing Whole Grains: Tend to contain some beneficial nutrients but taste bland.

7. Gluten-Containing Whole Grains: Similar to non-gluten grains in nutrient content, but gluten may negatively impact the antioxidant system by increasing gut permeability.

8. Leafy Vegetables: Not enough calories, taste terrible on their own, and are hard to digest, but do not negatively impact health for most people. Useful for flavoring dishes and often contain bioactive polyphenolic antioxidants.

9. Refined Grains: Taste great but offer very few nutrient benefits.

10. Refined Sugars: Taste great but provide zero nutrient benefits.

I included taste as an important factor in the rankings because why eat foods that don't taste good? This ranking order isn't absolute, and different people might prefer different foods towards the top of the list. As for the amount of carbohydrates, it doesn't matter because the total carbohydrate amount likely won't impact antioxidant defense, so restricting carb amounts is not necessary, but also not harmful; the quality of carbs is more important than the quantity. [Chris Masterjohn's course](https://chrismasterjohnphd.substack.com/s/masterclass-with-masterjohn-energy) on the antioxidant system delves into more detail about this.
